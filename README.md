# Luminous-Realm
A game I developed over 2 months. To get the game, go to the releases tab and select the latest version and extract the files into a folder. For those who want to compile the code, the default configuration for the game is in 64 bit (x64), release channel. If you want to run it in other configurations, you'll need to copy the resources over from bin/x64/release for the textures to work.
